<h1>Data Cleaning and Visualization Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a real dataset of Steam games. The goal is to apply data cleaning techniques, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and create meaningful visualizations using Python and libraries like NumPy and Pandas.
<br />

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>- Source: Steam Games Dataset</p>
<p>- Attributes: Game info including price, ratings, platforms, languages, etc.</p>

<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>- Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, normalized ratings, and processed multi-value columns.</p>
<p>- Visualizations: Created histograms, bar graphs, and a correlation matrix to better understand game characteristics.</p>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<p>- Languages: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)</p>
<p>- Jupyter Notebook: Used for organizing and running the project</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>- Improved data quality by removing irrelevant columns and cleaning null values.</p>
<p>- Generated insightful visualizations such as price distributions, platform support, and user ratings.</p>
